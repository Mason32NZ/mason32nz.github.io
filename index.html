                        <p>
                            My passion for programming has taken me from a small-town Rotorua school boy making games at home in GML, to a professional developer in a world were with AI, the skies the limit. I love what I do, especially designing a project in my head and watching the pieces fall in place as it comes together. I enjoy social drinks with colleagues, keeping up-to-date on the latest AI developments, and gaming. I was a good developer before the rise of AI, but now I ask myself: ‚Äúhow can I best automate myself out of a job‚Äù üòÇ
